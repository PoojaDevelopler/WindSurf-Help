# 🌤️ Moody

**Moody** is a one-screen SwiftUI demo app created entirely with the help of **AI** — powered by **WindSurf**, an AI-assisted development environment for Swift.  
The project showcases how natural language prompts can transform ideas into functional, visually refined iOS apps — with minimal manual coding.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project

Moody was built to demonstrate how developers can **co-create with AI** — moving from concept to code seamlessly.  
It’s a small, elegant example of blending design thinking, automation, and modern SwiftUI architecture.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 **AI-Generated Codebase** — built using WindSurf from a single developer prompt  
- 🎨 **Mood-based design** — changing background gradients and icons for each emotion  
- ⚡ **Smooth animations** — powered by SwiftUI transitions  
- 💡 **No third-party dependencies** — clean, native implementation  
- 🧩 **AI in action** — showcasing how prompt engineering accelerates development
