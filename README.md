About

Moody is a single-screen SwiftUI demo built entirely with WindSurf, an AI-powered development environment for Swift.
The app’s concept and structure came to life from a single prompt — no manual coding or Xcode setup required.

This project illustrates how WindSurf can transform a quick idea into a functional, well-structured Swift app, all through natural language guidance.

✨ Highlights

AI-generated from start to finish using WindSurf

Mood-based interface that changes color and animation based on emotion
